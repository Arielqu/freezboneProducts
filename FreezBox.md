DISCLAIMER 
Freezbone works best with moderate chewers, and every dog plays differently with it. Since not all toys are created equal, it’s always best to keep a close watch on your pup in case things get ruff. Supervised play will help the Freezdouble last longer and most importantly keep your pup safe. No dog toy is truly indestructible, so always remove the toy from playtime if pieces begin to break off. 

It's also recommended to keep the Freezbone pouches in the fridge once you open them. The pouches are not meant for human consumption.
